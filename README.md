# osbuild
OSBuild: a linker styled programming language created by HaxeFloppa.

<h2><i><b>I/O stream</b></i></h2>
To print a string, use the following lines to do so:

    BOOTLOADER_START
    {
        HELLO, WORLD!
    }
You can type whatever you want within the "HELLO, WORLD!" part. And no, the string to print doesn't need to be all caps. I'm just trying to look cool.
